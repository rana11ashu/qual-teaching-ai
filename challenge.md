# Challenge - Build a Code Executor Sandbox

## The Problem

Build an HTTP API that executes arbitrary Python code submitted by users. The code should run asynchronously with real-time streaming output.

## Requirements

### API Design:

```python
POST /execute
{
  "code": "print('hello world')"
}
→ {"task_id": "abc123"}

GET /tasks/{task_id}/stream  # Stream stdout as task runs
GET /tasks/{task_id}         # Get final result + status
```

Your executor will run untrusted code from the internet. Users may submit code that is buggy, inefficient, or intentionally malicious.

Your job is to make the system as safe and robust as possible within 2 hours.

## What we'd like to see:

- **Correctness**: Does it execute valid code properly?
- **Robustness**: How does it handle problematic code?
- **Security**: What protections exist against malicious code?
- **Design**: Code quality, architecture decisions, trade-offs

## Submission

Please provide:

1. A pull request with working code, setup instructions or a startup script
2. Your approach and any notes you want to share
3. Test examples - Show us any examples of problematic code you tested against and how your system handles them

**Note:** We don't expect a production-grade sandbox in 2 hours. We want to see your thought process, priorities, and how you approach a hard problem with limited time.

You should treat this as any task you would at work and feel free to use any tools, libraries you may use on a day-to-day basis. Coding with AI is fine, as long as you can take ownership of the code.

**Good luck! We're excited to see your submission.**
